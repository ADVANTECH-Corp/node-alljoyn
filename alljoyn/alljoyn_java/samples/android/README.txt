This directory contains the following set of AllJoyn usage samples:


simple -      This sample shows how to connect to a local AllJoyn daemon in 
              order to publish an AllJoyn object that implements a very simple
              interface. The sample also shows how to connect to the local
              daemon in order to execute a method on the published object.

secure -      This sample shows how to enable authentication and encryption for
              the simple sample.  The service supports multiple authentication
              mechanisms.  Each client supports one of the authentication
              mechanisms.

properties -  This sample shows how to use AllJoyn properties in an AllJoyn interface.

              devices.

              types.
