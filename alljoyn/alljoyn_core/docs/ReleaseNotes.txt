Compatibility
-------------
Version 14.12/14.12a/14.12b
- The AllJoyn protocol version changed from 10 to 11.
- As part of making UDP/ARDP robust compatibility was broken between the
  14.06 experimental version and the current implementation - this is not
  considered significant as UDP was disabled by default in 14.06.
- Self-Join - the addition of this feature means that applications can now
  join their own sessions, previously this was explicitly disallowed.
- The migration of the PropertyChanged signal from BusListener interface to
  ProxyBusObject interface impacts compatibility as it will prevent
  applications based on AllJoyn 14.06a and older from receiving this signal
  from those based on 14.12 and newer, and vice versa. The impact should
  not be significant since the the PropertiesChanged functionality prior to
  the 14.12 release did not work.
- The addition of the heartbeat from the router to a Thin Core App (TCA) can
  result in a TCA being disconnected if it is unable to respond to the
  AllJoyn Ping within the probe timeout period of 3 seconds.
