			/**
			 * @brief Start the process of spinning up the independent threads used in
			 * the bus attachment, preparing it for action.
			 *
			 * This method only begins the process of starting the bus. Sending and
			 * receiving messages cannot begin until the bus is Connect()ed.
			 *
			 * In most cases, it is not required to understand the threading model of
			 * the bus attachment, with one important exception: The bus attachment may
			 * send callbacks to registered listeners using its own internal threads.
			 * This means that any time a listener of any kind is used in a program, the
			 * implication is that a the overall program is multithreaded, irrespective
			 * of whether or not threads are explicitly used.  This, in turn, means that
			 * any time shared state is accessed in listener methods, that state must be
			 * protected.
			 *
			 * As soon as Start() is called, clients of a bus attachment with listeners
			 * must be prepared to receive callbacks on those listeners in the context
			 * of a thread that will be different from the thread running the main
			 * program or any other thread in the client.
			 *
			 * Although intimate knowledge of the details of the threading model are not
			 * required to use a bus attachment (beyond the caveat above) we do provide
			 * methods on the bus attachment that help users reason about more complex
			 * threading situations.  This will apply to situations where clients of the
			 * bus attachment are multithreaded and need to interact with the
			 * multithreaded bus attachment.  These methods can be especially useful
			 * during shutdown, when the two separate threading systems need to be
			 * gracefully brought down together.
			 *
			 * The BusAttachment methods Start(), Stop() and Join() all work together to
			 * manage the autonomous activities that can happen in a BusAttachment.
			 * These activities are carried out by so-called hardware threads.  POSIX
			 * defines functions used to control hardware threads, which it calls
			 * pthreads.  Many threading packages use similar constructs.
			 *
			 * In a threading package, a start method asks the underlying system to
			 * arrange for the start of thread execution.  Threads are not necessarily
			 * running when the start method returns, but they are being *started*.  Some time later,
			 * a thread of execution appears in a thread run function, at which point the
			 * thread is considered *running*.  At some later time, executing a stop method asks the
			 * underlying system to arrange for a thread to end its execution.  The system
			 * typically sends a message to the thread to ask it to stop doing what it is doing.
			 * The thread is running until it responds to the stop message, at which time the
			 * run method exits and the thread is considered *stopping*.
			 *
			 * Note that neither of Start() nor Stop() are synchronous in the sense that
			 * one has actually accomplished the desired effect upon the return from a
			 * call.  Of particular interest is the fact that after a call to Stop(),
			 * threads will still be *running* for some non-deterministic time.
			 *
			 * In order to wait until all of the threads have actually stopped, a
			 * blocking call is required.  In threading packages this is typically
			 * called join, and our corresponding method is called Join().
			 *
			 * A Start() method call should be thought of as mapping to a threading
			 * package start function.  it causes the activity threads in the
			 * BusAttachment to be spun up and gets the attachment ready to do its main
			 * job.  As soon as Start() is called, the user should be prepared for one
			 * or more of these threads of execution to pop out of the bus attachment
			 * and into a listener callback.
			 *
			 * The Stop() method call should be thought of as mapping to a threading
			 * package stop function.  It asks the BusAttachment to begin shutting down
			 * its various threads of execution, but does not wait for any threads to exit.
			 *
			 * A call to the Join() method should be thought of as mapping to a
			 * threading package join function call.  It blocks and waits until all of
			 * the threads in the BusAttachment have in fact exited their Run functions,
			 * gone through the stopping state and have returned their status.  When
			 * the Join() method returns, one may be assured that no threads are running
			 * in the bus attachment, and therefore there will be no callbacks in
			 * progress and no further callbacks will ever come out of a particular
			 * instance of a bus attachment.
			 *
			 * It is important to understand that since Start(), Stop() and Join() map
			 * to threads concepts and functions, one should not expect them to clean up
			 * any bus attachment state when they are called.  These functions are only
			 * present to help in orderly termination of complex threading systems.

			 * subsystems.  Common subsystems are "ALLJOYN" for core AllJoyn code,
			 * "ALLJOYN_OBJ" for the sessions management code and "ALLJOYN_NS" for
			 * the TCP name services.  Debug levels for specific subsystems override
			 * the setting for "ALL" subsystems.  For example if "ALL" is set to 7,
			 * but "ALLJOYN_OBJ" is set to 1, then detailed debug output will be
			 * generated for all subsystems except for "ALLJOYN_OBJ" which will only
			 * generate high level debug output.  "ALL" defaults to 0 which is off,
			 * or no debug output.
			 *
			 * The debug output levels are actually a bit field that controls what
			 * output is generated.  Those bit fields are described below:
			 *
			 *     - 0x1: High level debug prints (these debug printfs are not common)
			 *     - 0x2: Normal debug prints (these debug printfs are common)
			 *     - 0x4: Function call tracing (these debug printfs are used
			 *            sporadically)
			 *     - 0x8: Data dump (really only used in the "SOCKET" module - can
			 *            generate a *lot* of output)
			 *
			 * Typically, when enabling debug for a subsystem, the level would be set
			 * to 7 which enables High level debug, normal debug, and function call
			 * tracing.  Setting the level 0, forces debug output to be off for the
			 * specified subsystem.
			 *
			 * @param module    name of the module to generate debug output
			 * @param level     debug level to set for the module
			 *
			 * @return
			 *     - QStatus.OK if debug request was successfully sent to the AllJoyn
			 *       daemon.
